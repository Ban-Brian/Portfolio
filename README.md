This repository contains a Python application designed for interactive data input, analysis, and visualization of financial metrics and percentages. It enables users to enter and update variable data through a simple GUI, with real-time plotting capabilities. This project is intended for educational, research, and project reporting purposes, particularly where clear, interpretable data visualizations are necessary.

Features
	•	Graphs multiple variables (e.g., Revenue, Expenses, Profit Margin) over time.
	•	Supports both raw numerical values and percentages.
	•	Real-time visualization using Matplotlib.
	•	Interactive GUI for input using Tkinter.
	•	Error handling for invalid or incomplete inputs.
	•	Dynamic labeling and formatting (currency, percentage).
	•	Option menus to define the type of each variable (currency, percentage).

Technologies Used
	•	Python 3.x
	•	Matplotlib – for plotting graphs.
	•	Tkinter – for building the interactive user interface.

How It Works
	1.	Launch the application.
	2.	Input data for each variable as a comma-separated list.
	3.	Specify the data type (e.g., “currency”, “percentage”) from the dropdown.
	4.	Click “Submit” to update the values and plot them instantly.
	5.	The graph adjusts axis formatting depending on the data type.
